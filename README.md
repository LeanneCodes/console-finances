# Console Finances

Using pure Javascript to parse through a dataset and analyse the following:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset.
2. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Then finally console.log the results.
